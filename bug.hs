```haskell
import Data.List (sort)

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let xs = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  let ys = sort xs
  print ys
```
This code compiles and runs correctly, sorting the list `xs`. However, a subtle bug arises if `xs` contains elements that are not comparable using the default `Ord` instance. For example, if `xs` includes a mix of `Int` and `String` values, a runtime error will occur.
```haskell
import Data.List (sort)

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let xs = [1, "2", 3]
  let ys = sort xs
  print ys
```
This code will fail to compile because Haskell's type system will prevent the implicit conversion and comparison of mixed data types.
