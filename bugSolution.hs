```haskell
import Data.List (sortOn)
import Data.Ord (comparing)

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let xs = [1, "2", 3, "4", 5]
  let ys = sortOn show xs -- sort based on string representation
  print ys

-- Alternative solution using a custom type class and instance:
-- data MyData = IntData Int | StringData String deriving (Show)
-- instance Ord MyData where
--   compare (IntData a) (IntData b) = compare a b
--   compare (StringData a) (StringData b) = compare a b
--   compare _ _ = error "Incomparable types"
-- 
-- main :: IO ()
-- main = do
--   let xs = [IntData 1, StringData "2", IntData 3]
--   let ys = sort xs
--   print ys
```
The solution uses `sortOn` with `show` to convert all elements to strings before sorting. This is a safer way to handle sorting heterogeneous data.  An alternative (commented out) approach involves defining a custom `Ord` instance to explicitly handle the comparison of different data types.
